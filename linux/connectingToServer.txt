The recent wave of ransomware revealed that there is an increased threat against the vulnerability of the SMBv1 protocol. Many admins therefore disabled SMB1 for security reasons.

This causes a compatibility issue with the default access method in Ubuntu. Till an update is received, below is what you should be observing, as the machines need to be explicitely told to use the never access protocols.

$ smbclient  //bph-hm-labs.win.ad.jhu.edu/lab-home -U username -W WIN
Enter username's password:
protocol negotiation failed: NT_STATUS_CONNECTION_RESET


You can overcome this problem by changing the protocol:
$ smbclient  //bph-hm-labs.win.ad.jhu.edu/lab-home -U username -m SMB3 -W WIN
WARNING: The "syslog" option is deprecated
Enter username's password:
Domain=[WIN] OS=[] Server=[]
smb: \>


Nemo GUI cannot connect as it uses the default GUI, so you need to mount with cifs:
$ sudo mount -t cifs -o username=username,domain=WIN,vers=3.0 //bph-hm-labs.win.ad.jhu.edu/lab-home ./serv
Password for username@//bph-hm-labs.win.ad.jhu.edu/:


It might help putting this on your startup script, such as /etc/rc.local.
